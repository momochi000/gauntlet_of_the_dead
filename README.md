# Browser Gauntlet (working title)

## Concept
A multiplayer browser based action game where a group of players collaborate
to fight monsters and reach their goal(s)

## Some gameplay thoughts/ideas
Rather than a fantasy setting a la Gauntlet, the theme could be zombie based
with players navigating the endless hordes attempting to reach a safehouse.
